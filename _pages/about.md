## Prospective Students
**Prospective students:** I’m actively seeking highly motivated and talented **PhD** students. If you are excited about the following topics, let’s talk: passive/active robotic perception, scene understanding/scene completion, and neuro-symbolic reasoning for robotic systems.

**How to contact me:** email your CV, links (code/papers/videos), and a brief description of your research interests.

**Undergraduates at Oakland University:** I am hiring current undergraduates who are interested in continuing at Oakland University for an MS and/or PhD. If that’s you, please reach out. You can also stop by my office in EC 334.


## About Me
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.oakland.edu/cse/) at [Oakland University](https://www.oakland.edu/). My research lies in the intersection of perception, decision making, and scene understanding for robotic systems.
<!-- I am a Research Scientist at the [SPARKlab](https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/) working with [Prof. Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/) in the [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/). -->

<!-- My main research interests lie in the intersection of perception and decision making for robotic systems with a focus on passive and active perception in unstructured and perceptually degraded environments for 3D scene understanding. -->

<!-- I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, from 2021-2023.  -->
I was previously a Research Scientist from 2023-2025 and and Postdoctoral Associate from 2021-2023 in the [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/) where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/) in the [SPARKlab](https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/) .
In 2021, I received a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on perception-aware planning for robotic systems from the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mmae.statler.wvu.edu/) at [West Virginia University (WVU)](https://www.wvu.edu/) where I was advised by [Prof. Yu Gu](https://yugu.faculty.wvu.edu/home), and I was a visiting researcher and affiliate from 2018-2019 at [NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) working with [Dr. Kyohei Otsu](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/kyohei_otsu/) and [Dr. Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi]().
From 2014-2016 under the advisement of Prof. Yu Gu, I led the software development for perception and navigation for the WVU team in NASA's Centennial Sample Return Robot Challenge (SRRC) winning $850,000 for 1st place in the [2015](https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-u-s-senate-welcome-robot-challenge-winners-to-washington/) and [2016](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/nasa-awards-750k-in-sample-return-robot-challenge-for-autonomous-technology/) challenges.
