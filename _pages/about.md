## About Me

I am a Research Scientist at the [SPARKlab](https://web.mit.edu/sparklab/) working with [Prof. Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/) in the [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](https://aeroastro.mit.edu/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)](https://www.mit.edu/).

My main research interests lie in the intersection of perception and decision making for robotic systems with a focus on passive and active perception in unstructured and perceptually degraded environments for 3D scene understanding.

I was a Postdoctoral Associate at MIT, from 2021-2023. In 2021, I received a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering with a focus on perception-aware planning for robotic systems from the [Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering](https://mmae.statler.wvu.edu/) at [West Virginia University (WVU)](https://www.wvu.edu/) where I was advised by [Prof. Yu Gu](https://yugu.faculty.wvu.edu/home). During my Ph.D., I was a visiting researcher and affiliate at the [NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) from 2018-2019 working with [Dr. Kyohei Otsu](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/who-we-are/people/kyohei_otsu/) and [Dr. Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi](). From 2014-2016 under the advisement of Prof. Yu Gu, I led the software development for perception, navigation, and planning for the WVU team for NASA's Centennial Sample Return Robot Challenge (SRRC) winning $750,000 for [1st place](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/stmd/prizes-challenges-crowdsourcing-program/nasa-awards-750k-in-sample-return-robot-challenge-for-autonomous-technology/) in the 2016 challenge.

## Fun Facts
I marched snare with Drum Corps International (DCI) groups Southwind 2007, Spirit of Atlanta 2008-2010, and Phantom Regiment 2011 (as center snare from 2009-2011). Many thanks to the members and staff especially [Joe Hobbs](https://www.innovativepercussion.com/artists/joe_hobbs) and [Shane Gwaltney](https://www.innovativepercussion.com/artists/shane_gwaltney)!
